Introduction:

This script opens an SPICE connection to a VM from cmdline. It does the following actions:

- Searches the VM ID from a given VM Name
- Extracts display info params: host, port and calculates the secure port
- Creates a ticket for the VM
- Downloads the CA certificate from RHEV-M using wget
- Runs the command 'spicec' with the proper params

Usage:

- Install the python-rhev package, instructions at:
https://code.google.com/p/rhev-api-labs/wiki/Main#Python

- Run the command:
$ ./spice.py --url=https://rhevm.example.com:8443/rhevm-api-powershell --username=<rhevadmin>@<domain> --password=<mypass> <vmname>

It's also possible to pass the following params as env variables with:
$ export RHEV_url="https://rhevm.example.com:8443/rhevm-api-powershell"
$ export RHEV_username=..
$ export RHEV_password=..

Tested with:
RHEV 2.2
spice-client-0.6.3 from RHEL6

Note: this script is currently incompatible with spice-0.5 from RHEL5, although it's easy to adapt
