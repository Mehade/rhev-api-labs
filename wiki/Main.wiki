== Introduction ==

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) is a complete virtualization platform including the KVM hypervisor and the RHEV Manager web console. Since RHEV2.2 there is a REST API to manage and automate all aspects of your virtualization infrastructure.

rhev-api-labs aims to provide sample code for different languages that can leverage the REST API features.
